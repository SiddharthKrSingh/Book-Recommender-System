# Book-Recommender-System
Recommender System leverages both collaborative filtering and popularity-based filtering, making it a versatile tool for book recommendations.

1. Collaborative Filtering:
This approach uses user interaction data, such as ratings or past behavior, to suggest books that similar users liked. Used a user-item interaction matrix and techniques i.e. cosine similarity  to make personalized recommendations.

2. Popularity-Based Filtering:
This is a simpler method where the most popular books (by rating count, average ratings, etc.) are recommended. It's useful for users without much interaction history or as a fallback when personalized recommendations aren't available.

3. Flask for Deployment:
   Built a web interface using Flask, allowing users to interact with the recommendation system. Flask serves as the backend framework for routing requests and delivering book recommendations.

4. Render for Deployment:
After developing the system locally, Deployed it using Render, making the app accessible online.
